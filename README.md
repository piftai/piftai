## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently working on my project Parcelz and working as Backend developer.
- I'm learning Golang - I think that this is the most productive language for me right now. 
- Pull of my technologies: Go, Python, Docker, PostgreSQL, REST, gRPC, ngrok, JS, bash, Linux. (trying to learning DevOps too, it's very interesting)
